## What changed

## Checklist
- [ ] The branch is named per [Conventional Branch](../CONTRIBUTING.md#branches) (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`, `chore/`).
- [ ] New behaviour has a test, and docs that describe the changed behaviour are updated in this PR.
- [ ] Nothing synced from vEXOULZ/conventions was edited by hand (`.conventions/`, managed blocks).
- [ ] **No private infrastructure**: no machine hostnames, private IPs, server paths, proxy/tunnel config or deploy scripts. Those belong in the private infrastructure repo.
- [ ] No secret values anywhere in the diff, the description or the commit messages.

## vexoulz-vods
- [ ] **Mobile has the same functions as desktop.** Checked at ~390px: controls reflow or scroll, nothing is hidden.
- [ ] Controls use the fixed heights (32px / 26px small); the header stays 48px (or is hidden in theater mode).
- [ ] Images, logos and icons are placeholders until real assets exist.
- [ ] Time logic (parts, cuts, chat clock) lives in vods-core, not here.
